Thank you so much, Lisa! 

I have shared the Dropbox photo files with you, so let me know if you have received them. You don't have to use them all, but I sent them all so you could choose according to how they will fit in the layout,etc. 

*In fact, if you could only use my "serious" solo shot for my BIO pic and not on the main, that would be great (Please don't post the smiling shot of just me on the site, I'm gonna use that for other materials).  The other band members will have updated solo shots very soon, and I'll send those in as they come.  

Can you make it so that people can't copy the photos from the site? They are (c) 2014. 

Let me know what else you need from us.  Looking forward to seeing the new site!

"Here are 3 additional hi-res shots. Let me know if you need anything else from me. Thanks!"


"These are the Hi-Res photos from the most recent photo shoot. Please only use them for our website. Thank you! I will be sending you a link to another folder with a few other newer shots you can include. Thanks so much again, and I look forward to seeing what you can do with the site."
