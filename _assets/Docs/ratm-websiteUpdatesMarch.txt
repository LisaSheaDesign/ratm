Can you ping Lisa and see if she can put the poster on the home page, and underneath put a link to the ticket page?( Text: Tickets on sale April 1st , link:  http://ratm.bpt.me ) 

I've attached the .jpg. Here's the photobucket link in case she needs that: http://s232.photobucket.com/user/rhythmandthemethod/media/1596dda0-842b-41a0-a7dd-87dcd6c55904_zps5996d7c0.jpg.html 

Also see if she can add the social tab to the bottom bar on the far left or far right and just put the individual logos/links instead of a pop-up tab, adding our new Instagram (instagram.com/rhythmatm).
