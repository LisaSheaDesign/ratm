				<h2>Our Mission</h2>
				<p>Throughout history, music has marked a change in the times, inspired growth, evoked emotion, provoked thought, and has always been synchronous with revolution. We are now on the verge of such revolution, and Rhythm and the Method is determined to write the soundtrack. The music we create is meant to awaken human beings to the realization that they themselves hold the key to unlocking their highest potential; that they, as all of us, are living during this certain time, under these certain circumstances, for a very profound reason: We all have deep, individual missions to fulfill in this life.</p>
				<p>Rhythm and the Method knows that our mission allows us to tap into our own limitless potential through our gifts of song and word. These gifts can (and will) change the world. Political struggle, social change, environmental awareness, and overcoming internal strife: These are topics often exemplified by Rhythm and the Method's poetically passionate lyrics. They signify the desire to contribute to the propagation of spirituality, positive thinking, peaceful resolution, and the enlightenment of human beings as a whole in this lifetime.</p>
				<p>With our music we bring a message of hope, of inspiration, and of love to all who are willing to listen, and still, we play our hearts out for those who are not.</p>

					<p>Born in San Diego in 1983, <strong>Rhythm Turner</strong> always knew her mission was to be a musician and performer. She grew up in a musical family, and as a young girl, would bang on buckets while her father played guitar. Music and art coursed through her veins and could be found everywhere in her environment thanks to her loving and creative parents. She picked up a few chords on guitar, but was very much drawn to the percussive rhythm instruments. She began playing concert percussion in middle school, as well as marching and concert drums for the lay Buddhist organization, Soka Gakkai International. By the 8th grade she started playing drums with her friends in various rock and punk bands.</p>
					<p>Shortly after she turned 16, she auditioned for several giging bands, but was too young to play the bar scene. Regardless, Rhythm pressed on and worked on her chops in high school drum-line and at home. As she grew and progressed in both poetry and music, she began a progressive, experimental fusion band with her brother, Evan, which would be the beginning of her songwriting journey.</p>
					<p>At the age of 19, Rhythm found her first steady gig playing and working for an original southern-rock band. It was then when she picked the guitar back up and began realizing her true passion lied in songwriting. Rhythm took the lead and began her own project, joined once gain by her talented brother, Evan, and backed by their father, Papa Shawn, and Rhythm and the Method was born. After auditioning a slew of bassists and accompanists, Rhythm and the Method finally found the perfect pieces to the puzzle; bassist, vocalist and executive producer Laura Payne, and Boston-born blues enthusiast and harmonica player, Nick "Chowda" Walsh- and the rest is history. The band enjoys rotating musicians and drummers, as they are still in search for the next permanent member.</p>
					<p>Currently, Rhythm and the Method is proving to be a fast growing, successful, and passionate endeavor which Rhythm couldn't be more proud of.  She has also gained experience through playing in several different projects, recording, and performing. To this day she is expanding her knowledge by traveling and studying styles of music from around the world. Rhythm Turner is dedicated to a life of creating music to affect change in people individually, and in society as a whole.</p>

						<p><strong>Papa Shawn</strong> is a California native that spent his early childhood living in many areas between San Diego and L.A. In his early teens his folks relocated to Auburn, just east of Sacramento. It was there that he discovered his passion for the Arts. During his high school years he was involved in many artistic endeavors including, the school choir and several drama and musical productions. At the age of 15 years, with the help and encouragement of his grandmother, he received his first guitar. Spending many hours every day in his room he finally felt ready to share his new found love. At that point he began performing in various musical groups as well. In 1970 Shawn came back to San Diego to work in the shipyards and continue performing any chance he got. By 1976 he had formed a band called "Back to the Woods Hoods" which played original music around the SD area.</p> 
						<p>In 1978 while playing a gig in Hillcrest, Shawn met the future mother of his children. "It was love at first sight." By 1980 they were married. A few years latter there were two beautiful children and Shawn decided to keep the music at home. Rhythm and Evan showed interest in music at a very early age as they were exposed to a wide variety of artists. By the early teens their drive to perform was already in place.</p>
						<p>It was in year 2001 that Shawn made a determination to get back into the music scene thinking that playing some open mics would be fun. As fate would have it he ended up joining forces with a new all age performance venues called the "Hot Monkey Love Cafe where he supplies the sound and support for many of the young developing artists in San Diego. Among these artists were his own children. In 2004 he was invited to join his daughter and son to form a band. "Rhythm and the Method" was born. The rest, as they say is history. Papa Shawn says" I'm the happiest dad on earth when playing with my children and they want me to be there. What more could a parent want?"</p>

					<p><strong>Laura Payne</strong> was born with a great love for music. She began her musical journey at the age of 9 through classical guitar training. The love of learning and playing music continued through to her teenage years, when rock n roll became the main focus. She obtained her first electric guitar and amp at 14 and started learning how to rock from influences such as Heart, Joan Jett, The Cars, Aerosmith, etc. At 18, Laura joined her first rock band as a bassist purely out of necessity because no one else wanted to play bass at that time. Laura fell in love with the instrument since that moment on and has been driven to continuously learn and improve her skills. She has been involved in many different music projects across different genres: Rock, Blues, R&amp;B, Jazz, Folk, Big Band, Bossa Nova, etc. Some of her previous bands included: Misbehaven, Luna, The Limit, Roam, 1621, Basement Blues Band, Stylz, Color Scheme, Quirktet, and Anything that Moves.</p>
					<p>Ever since meeting and performing with Rhythm Turner by chance at a Community Center event in February 2007, then joining Rhythm and the Method a few days afterward, her love of music has expanded exponentially. Laura's passion now consists of playing, recording and sharing great music which reaches the masses alongside the best bandmates she's ever known - the talented musicians of Rhythm and the Method!</p>
					<p>To keep her chops up and musical skills growing, Laura also collaborates with the following music projects:  Kitten with a Whip, Full Strength Funk Band, Groove Ride, Wild Older Women, Big Band Ambassadors, and Lillian Lefranc.</p>
