		<h2>May 2014: Rhythm's Back! So let's celebrate....</h2>
		<p>A welcome home concert event, RoundTrip , is set for 7pm on Friday, May 30th at Queen Bee's Arts and Cultural Center in North Park to celebrate the reuniting Rhythm and the Method, and front-woman Rhythm Turner's return to San Diego after nearly two years traveling and living in Indonesia.</p>

		<p>"It was a time in my life when I knew I needed to see what was out there in the world. The experience and knowledge I've gained from doing so is truly priceless; but I'm so glad to be coming home!" says Turner.</p>

		<p>Supporting artists on the bill are award winning soul-jazz artist Steph Johnson, as well as Bart Mendoza &amp; True Stories, a household name in the local indie music scene.</p>

		<p>Other performances include tribal belly-dancing troop, Iza Moon Dance Collective, and visual artist, Jim Chelius. Host for the evening is the one and only Tim Pyles from The Local 94/9 Radio Show. The official after-party will feature music spun by DJ Red Light.</p>

		<p>VIP tickets include exclusive discounts, merchandise, and entrance to a pre-show meet &amp; greet.  Food provided in-house and beer by San Diego's Mike Hess Brewing Company.</p>

		<p>Rhythm and the Method has been a part of many San Diego communities since 2007. Its members have played and contributed to several local venues, festivals, and charitable events, including Belly Up Tavern, Humphrey's Backstage Lounge, San Diego &amp; South Bay Prides, Concerts on the Green, and fundraisers for various causes. The band believes in positively contributing to their community and aims to inspire others by creating value from their shared experiences.</p>

		<p>When asked to comment, Payne expressed that Rhythm and the Method is "one of the greatest bands I've had the honor to work with." She then added, "The synergy, the music, and the magic is alive and well, and I can't wait to hit the scene again with my band-family".</p>
